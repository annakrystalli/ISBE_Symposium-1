# Introduction to Reproducible Research in R and R Studio.

In this session, we are going to get you started with using version control from within RStudio. 

The material is self-paced and includes a worked-example. It is suggested that you work through the sections in order.

## Version control with git and github

* [~Installing the software~](./installing_software.md) - Get what you need on your own machine
* [~Getting an account on github~](./github.md) - Sign up for github
* [1. Creating an RStudio project](./rstudio_project.md) - Creating an example, version controlled project
* [2. Starting our analysis project](./analysis_start.md) - A simple script to get us started
* [3. Getting our project under version control](./version_control.md) - First step into a larger world
* [4. Making a change](./making_change.md) - Making our script more useful
* [5. Committing our change](./commit.md) - How to commit a change
* [6. Connecting our local repository to github](./github_sync.md) - Backup! Making our code available to the world.
* [7. Subsequent updates](./updates.md) - Now we are set up, the workflow is easy.
* [8. The example repo](./created_earlier.md) - My version of the repo we've created today
* [9. Things we haven't told you](./next_steps.md) - Steps to further learning
